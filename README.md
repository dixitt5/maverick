## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

1. There is no GameFi streaming infrastructure for monetization to reach the desired goal in terms of payouts in crypto and NFTs

 2. A centralized streaming platform is disadvantaging streamers by employing unfair compensation practices such as high commission rates, arbitrary increases determined by the company, extended holding periods for funds, confusing rules regarding account bans based on legal matters, a lack of transparency, and a failure to reach a consensus with the community, thereby undermining the valuable influence and support that streamers have built to achieve success.

 3. Replace the way of acquiring, engaging, and retaining users of web2 game publishers (paid ads, paid media) with Web3 (growth based on contribution - airdrop, referral, engagement).
 

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
Zeststream is a blockchain-driven initiative that seeks to tackle the obstacles faced by the GameFi sector by establishing a live streaming platform for gaming, facilitating tournament organization, and establishing an inventive and enduring economy for players

The next evolutionary step is towards Gamefi streaming platform. Create a sustainable ecosystem running on blockchain where game publishers, streamers and the gamer community all benefit from the contribution.

The expansion of the gaming community has exacerbated this issue. Due to the absence of innovative projects that address these constraints, Metastream was developed. It is a platform that merges the finest elements of entertainment and decentralized finance (DeFi) to bring together gamers, GameFi projects, and guilds through streaming.
